This is a python project suggested to act upon by my dear dad.
The code will use an excel file to store its data.
The excel file should have a specific format.
its main purpose is to save billing data in the excel file.
The code scans for already existing data using the phone number, and loads the details if the phone number matches.


Any suggestion regarding increase in efficency is most welcome.
